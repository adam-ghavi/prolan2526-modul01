Reflection 1

Through this module I learned the basics of Spring and in particular, MVC architecture. It was a bit out of my comfort zone since I had been coding using Django up until this point, which uses its own architecture, namely MVT. But after getting used to how spread-out the files are, it wasn't so bad.

As far as coding standards are concerned, I feel like the features I implemented were relatively simple, and so I'm fairly sure that there aren't any glaring issues in my code. I did however add a UUID feature to the code, as I was struggling with figuring out how to reliably make sure that Product Id's don't clash for the edit/delete feature. I'm unsure whether or not that addition adheres to coding best practices or if I was supposed to make it so that the Id's are manually assignable.
